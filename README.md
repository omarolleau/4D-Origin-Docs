# 4D-Origin-Docs

## Introduction

The original 4D documentation was very simple and effective.
Even though the new documentation has many advantages, I think it's domageable to lose this simplicity.

So I generated the documentation in the same format as the original.

## Notes

- The commands, details have been remaped to the new documentation.
- The constants, details are currently unavailable.
